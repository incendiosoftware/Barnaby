# Critical: package vs build

- **"package"** or **"package and run"** → use `npm run package` (bumps version). NEVER use `npm run build`.
- **"build"** or **"build and run"** → use `npm run build` (no version bump).

# Build Defaults

- This project is a local desktop executable workflow.
- For generic build requests, run `npm run build` (portable-only).
- Avoid `npm run build:dist` for normal user-facing builds unless user explicitly asks for dist-only output.
- Use `npm run build:release` only when user explicitly asks for full release/installer artifacts.

# Versioning

- Build commands that include `build:dist` auto-increment version.
- After build, always mention the new version and artifact path.

# Incremental Semantics

- Each instruction includes prior steps. "build and package" = package (do not run build twice).
- **release** = package → commit → push → publish.

# Build + Run

- For "build and run" (no version bump): run `npm run build` first, then launch app.
- For "package and run" (version bump + distributable): run `npm run package` first, then launch app.
