# Deploy Semantics

- Do not ask "where to deploy" for normal build requests.
- Default assumption: local artifact build only.
- Treat "deploy" as publish/release distribution only when user explicitly asks.

# Required Build Output Summary

After build, report:

- Version number
- Exact artifact filename/path
- File timestamp
- File size
